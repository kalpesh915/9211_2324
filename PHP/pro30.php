        PHP The static Keyword
        Normally, when a function is completed/executed, all of its variables are deleted. However, sometimes we want a local variable NOT to be deleted. We need it for a further job.
        To do this, use the static keyword when you first declare the variable:

            Then, each time the function is called, that variable will still have the information it contained from the last time the function was called.
            Note: The variable is still local to the function.
