            Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values. PHP divides the operators in the following groups:

            Arithmetic operators
            Assignment operators
            Comparison operators
            Increment/Decrement operators
            Logical operators
            String operators
            Array operators
            Conditional assignment operators
   
            PHP Arithmetic Operators
            The PHP arithmetic operators are used with numeric values to perform common arithmetical operations, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication etc.
