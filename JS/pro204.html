    /*
        Numeric Sort
        By default, the sort() function sorts values as strings. This works well for strings ("Apple" comes before "Banana"). If numbers are sorted as strings, "25" is bigger than "100", because "2" is bigger than "1". Because of this, the sort() method will produce incorrect result when sorting numbers. You can fix this by providing a compare function:
    */ 

    document.write("<hr>" + data.sort(function(x, y) {return x - y;}));

    /*
        x       y       ans     result
        12      34      -22     -ve
        34      32      2       +ve
        34      12      22      +ve
        12      12      0       no swap
        
        When the sort() function compares two values, it sends the values to the compare function, and sorts the values according to the returned (negative, zero, positive) value.
        If the result is negative, a is sorted before b. If the result is positive, b is sorted before a. If the result is 0, no changes are done with the sort order of the two values.
