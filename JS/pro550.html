    /*
        Callback Alternatives
        With asynchronous programming, JavaScript programs can start long-running tasks, and continue running other tasks in paralell.
        But, asynchronus programmes are difficult to write and difficult to debug.
        Because of this, most modern asynchronous JavaScript methods don't use callbacks. Instead, in JavaScript, asynchronous programming is solved using Promises instead.
